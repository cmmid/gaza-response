This study aims to monitor the nutritional status of humanitarian staff currently working in Gaza by tracking their weight. Our goal is to inform humanitarian decision-making, advocacy and diplomatic action to improve the lives of the affected population by providing real-time information on the nutritional status of humanitarian staff in Gaza.

This site will shortly be home to a live dashboard showing up to date results from the study. To find out more, visit the [About](./about) page.
