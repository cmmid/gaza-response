Summary of most recent data provided by participants reporting over the last 3 days. Current weight in kilograms (kg) and BMI (body mass index), in addition to percent change in weight and BMI from pre-war levels (before October 8th 2023) are shown on the x-axes of the panels. Negative values of percent change indicate weight loss, i.e. ‘-20%’ indicates an average loss of 20% of weight or BMI.

### Trends

TBD
